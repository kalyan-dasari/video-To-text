Reason Behind the Creation of This Project:
My father is a journalist, and he often types news articles based on videos of politicians, victims, or other sources. He used to listen to the video and manually type everything, which was time-consuming. To help him work more efficiently, I suggested using a split-screen setup—playing the video on one half of the screen and typing on the other.

Initially, this worked well. He would play the video on the upper half of the screen and use a Telugu speech-to-text tool on the lower half. This allowed him to transcribe the audio quickly instead of typing everything by hand. However, after a few phone updates, this functionality stopped working. Playing a video and using speech-to-text simultaneously was no longer supported.

This situation inspired me to develop a simple solution—a web page that streamlines this entire process.

How It Works:
Upload Video: Choose the video you want to transcribe.
View Video: Click the Upload button to load and play the video on the page.
Start Voice Typing: Click the Start Voice Typing button. This will capture both the video's audio and your voice (if needed) for transcription.
View Text: The recognized text is displayed in real-time. You can stop the transcription whenever you wish.
Copy or Clear: Copy the transcribed text or clear it if you want to start over.
This project aims to simplify the transcription process for journalists and anyone working with video-based content. I’ve shared the project on GitHub for others to benefit from it.
